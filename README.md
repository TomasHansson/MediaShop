# MediaShop
A project done during a C#/.NET course at Karlstads university.

A piece of software ment to emulate a piece of software used by a mediashop to handle checkout, stock and statistics.

What I Learned:
- Preparing a design with a class diagram and adapting it as the project grew.
- Piecing together a somewhat larger project in order to meet the specified requirements.
- Using DataGridViews and associated BindingSources with Windows Forms.
- How to print a simple list (receipt) based on the contents of a DataGridView.
- How CSV-files are structured and how they may be used to store and load information.

While is wasn't part of the assignment, I decided to add some basic unit tests for the project, giving me an opportunity to practice writing unit tests since I've recently taken an online course on the subject.
- Writing basic unit tests.
